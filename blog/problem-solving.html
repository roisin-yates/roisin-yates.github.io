    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
    <p class="date-time">Wed 1 Feb 2023</p>

    <h3>Blocked on a simple problem</h3>
    <p>
      I was actually blocked on a very simple problem last week during the Javascript intro challenge. Surprisingly loops (as much
      as they make my brain hurt) weren't the part I found most difficult during the final challenge, reading the question turned out 
      to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent far longer than I should have on the stretch question for 7-loops-js: <code>//// 4. Define a function named `countShortNames` 
        that takes an array of strings and returns a count of all the strings with a length less than 5....Instead of a for loop, try using 
        a `for of` loop.</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept trying to create a new array, push the elements into that new array and return the length of the new array, which proved to be
      far too difficult. Especially as it was my first time using <code>for...of</code> loops.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried reading the documentation and that didn't help, neither did breaking the problem into smaller problems or writing pseudo-code.
      I only realised my mistake when out of desperation, I explained the question and my issues solving it to my dog, as if she would suddenly
      give me the answer. As silly as I felt at the time, the rubber ducky method really works. It takes a while to get over the self-consciousness
      talking about Javascript to a dog (or inanimate object), but it really does help to pick up on things you may have missed. In this case, I had completely
      glossed over the word <span class="bold">count</span>.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Within 3 minutes of this realisation the test passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've tried this method a few times again, particularly with the Javascript-kata challenges, and it has worked every single time. 
      I've also learnt to write down keywords from the questions so I don't accidentally miss them again.
    </p>


    <h3>Elegently solved a problem</h3>
    <p>
      After the shame of spending half an hour blocked by not reading a question properly, I was actually quite proud of my solution to
      deBee.js this week. I read the question fully, and the tests and then I wrote pseudo-code for the steps I should take. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had watched a video on array methods prior to the challenge, so I felt that I was prepared and understood that the method I needed
      to use; <code>.filter()</code> can only be called on arrays. My steps were:
    </p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>Turn string into array</li>
      <li>Create new array to filter the words into</li>
      <li>Filter the array with the parameter 'item'</li>
      <li>Return the 'item' that doesn't equal to 'buzz'</li>
      <li>Return the new array and join the contents as a string with spaces in between</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Perfect, but the last test didn't pass because it should filter out any words similar to 'buzz' - regardless of capitalisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      So my solution was that if the items in lowercase didn't equal to buzz to ignore them. <code>return item.toLowerCase() != 'buzz'</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't think this would pass if some of the strings you want to keep have letters in uppercase, but for the purposes of the test I 
      was very proud of the solution.
    </p>

    <h3>How confident am I with problem solving?</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Pseudo-code:</span> I am very happy with the way I've used pseudo-code to help solve problems. It really does 
      break things down into smaller steps so you get that dopamine rush after solving one of the smaller problems - this has helped
      me from getting blocked a lot. Usually I get blocked because I don't know where to start, or get overwhelmed by a problem. Pseudo-code
      has helped me to feel more confident writing if I can get some steps that I know are correct, then I can know where I went wrong
      if I get stuck. I am very confident using it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Trying something:</span> This is actually what I usually just do. Before I tried actual problem solving techniques
      I was confident just attacking a problem head on by trying everything I could think of. This comes more naturally to me than anything
      else.  
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Rubber ducky:</span> This has worked amazingly for me. I don't have a rubber duck (though I wish I did), so I've 
      been explaining problems to my dog. It has helped to slow me down so I can think over it fully. The last few tests in Javascript-kata
      were solved by luck. I tried to create an object with bracket notation, but forgot that you have to use quotation marks if you're 
      trying to reference a key, but it for some reason worked. I watched videos and read documentation to try and figure out how and why it worked, and it only came to 
      me after explaining the research to my dog. So like reading the questions out to her, it also helps to get documentation to stick.
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Reading error messages:</span> I'm okay at reading error messages. I understand the difference between syntax, type 
      and reference errors, and can find the exact lines they are referring to. But sometimes the actual messages don't make sense to me. 
      Before I managed to solve the last questions in Javascript-kata I kept getting the error: <code>TypeError: Cannot set properties of Undefined</code>
      . I had to look up what that meant in the context. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Console.logging:</span> I've been trying to do this more, and I have found that it's helped. When I thought I was 
      pushing things to an array, or using a for loop correctly, console logging each step has helped me to figure out that I was making a mistake
      somewhere. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Googling:</span> One of the most common memes that I've seen about programmers is: 'What's the difference between Junior
      and Senior devs? The speed at which they google'. I've been googling documentation, youtube videos and questions on stack overflow and 
      they've all been very helpful. The only issue that I've had has been to actually know what to google. Since the problems that I'm 
      having are very specific to the questions and challenges, I've had to figure out which part to google to help solve it - the error 
      messages, the methods etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Asking your peers/coaches for help:</span> I have been avoiding asking peers and coaches for help. I am not confident 
      with either of these at all. I've put them together in the same technique as I do neither. I am definitely trying to get better, and 
      have managed to ask a couple of small questions. It's definitely much harder being remote - or even just asking such a large group
      of people. When I've been stuck with something in the past, I've managed to go up to a specific person, in person, and ask them to
      demonstrate, but you can't really do that online, especially since I really dislike video calls and messaging. I have had a couple of 
      direct messages to ask me questions about things I've helped to solve, so maybe that's the first step I can take - I can message people
      privately who seem to have a good grasp on an issue I'm stuck on. Definitely a lot of room for improvement here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Improving your process with reflection:</span> I'm not going to lie, I did go into each lesson not wanting to do the 
      reflections. They were the part I liked the least when I first started. But now, I can definitely see and feel their value. Reflecting on
      processes I've taken and methods I've used have helped me to understand concepts better - like talking through bracket notation with
      my dog. Although she's been a sounding board to bounce my confusion off of, I've been reflecting on the concepts that I'd just learnt 
      about. While I'm confident reflecting when I'm asked to, like with these blogs, I haven't made a huge effort to reflect when I'm 
      not prompted to. So this is something I can begin to work on.
    </p>
