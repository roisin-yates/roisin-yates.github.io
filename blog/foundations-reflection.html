    <h2>Foundations Reflection</h2>
    <p class="date-time">Thurs 9 Feb 2023</p>

    <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
    <ol class="article-list">
      <li>
        I have learnt that I had the preconception that our capabilities and skills lie in ‘talents’, or are ingrained and unchanging. 
        I thought that the way I think would always be the same, but that’s not actually the case. 
      </li>
      <li>
        I’ve learnt that my difficulty with focusing on a task is not lack of motivation or displeasure at not getting instant 
        gratification, but because it’s a type of learning I’m not used to. The schools and unis I’ve been to really just promote 
        rote memorisation - we wrote essays on topics and had to memorise quotes to things and themes that were already laid out for 
        us. So when faced with fending for myself or solving a problem that could have multiple viable solutions I’ve gotten 
        overwhelmed and moved on to something I feel I have more control over.
      </li>
      <li>
        I don’t like asking questions, not because I’m introverted like I tell everyone (I am definitely an introvert, but 
        it’s not the reason behind my dislike for this), but because I don’t want to seem like I don’t know something. 
        My ego gets me to show off skills I know I am good at and hide the ones I’m bad at. So it’s more a fear of being 
        looked down upon for not knowing something.
      </li>
    </ol>


    <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
    <p>
      Your values, empathy and self-awareness all affect how you interact with other people and how you think about yourself. 
      You may have certain values and empathies that you apply to yourself and not others, or vice versa, which can impede your 
      learning. If you’re too hard on yourself you can feel insecure and it can cause you to hide away from interacting with other 
      people or asking questions when you’re stuck with something. Imposter syndrome. If you’re too hard on others, you can make them 
      uncomfortable or appear unapproachable. Both of these things can prevent you from making meaningful relationships with the people 
      you’re learning with and can hold you back from valuable opportunities. Pair programming is such an important part any 
      programming role, so good communication and kindness is crucial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having the self-awareness of how you think is so important for adapting to this kind of environment. If you understand the way
       you treat yourself and others you can begin to make changes to make it easier for yourself and your peers to learn.
    </p>


    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      How important it actually is. I’ve been through so many human skills courses that just touched on communication 
      skills and the way we treat other people. This is the first one that has actually taught me things about myself. 
      I didn’t realise how much it would affect my learning during the course. After learning about neuroplasticity and then 
      problem solving, I realised that I could give it a proper try and that there is nothing that is ‘not for me’ - 
      I can give anything a go. And I found that it helped a lot. It made me a much better programmer than just memorising syntax would. 
    </p>

    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      Feeling so vulnerable and being honest about myself. My ego and self-consciousness dictate the way I talk about myself 
      to other people - I bring myself down specifically about things that don’t really matter, or things I know are very common. 
      They are insecurities, but no-one would judge me for having them. But I didn’t want to be fully honest and talk about flaws 
      that people might not actually like.
    </p>

    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development 
      Bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p>
      I think it’s something that universities and schools don’t prepare people for - you expect you can just get a job with your 
      qualifications or that a degree will be a sure way into a role, but that’s definitely not the case. The way you think about 
      yourself and other people is a huge sign if you will or won’t work well in a team. Someone who is self-aware and can give and 
      take valuable feedback and can think through every aspect of a problem is much more valuable than someone who just has a 
      qualification and no people skills. Especially in a role like programming, where you’re part of a team and have to work closely 
      with other people daily, where your code is getting reviewed and you have to take feedback well or review someone else’s code 
      and give them valuable feedback, it’s so important to understand core skills. 
    </p>

    <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that 
      time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p>
      Absolutely not. I’ve studied html, css and javascript before and went through the course understanding syntax, but not what 
      to do with it or where it could take me. The core skills taught me to slow down and break problems into smaller problems and 
      think through each one carefully. From learning about my personality, I can now work through smaller problems and get the 
      dopamine rush from solving them to stay motivated through the whole problem rather than just attacking it and giving up. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve learnt a lot more about myself and how I can communicate with people, though I haven’t put it into practice much yet so I
       won’t see the true value of it until pair programming in bootcamp.
