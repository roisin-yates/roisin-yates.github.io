    <h2>JavaScript and the DOM</h2>
    <p class="date-time">Fri 27 Jan 2023</p>

    <h3>What is <span class="emphasis-font">JavaScript?</span></h3>
    <p>Javascript is one of the most widely used programming languages, and for good reason. Javascript can be used to 
      add interactivity to a webpage, game, application, and almost anything you can think of. When combined with HTML and CSS, 
      it creates a reactive and interactive webpage.</p>
    <p>Together, Javascript, HTML and CSS form the core programming languages of front-end and web development.</p>
    <p>You can think of it as a paintbrush, as the title font may have indicated. In web development, 
      HTML forms the structure, the canvas. Primed with gesso, texturised, and with a plan of the painting applied, 
      a primed canvas is where most paintings begin. In and of itself, a canvas can be appreciated - 
      there is still a lot you can experience from a primed canvas. But how does the finished piece emerge?</p>
    <p>Through CSS color is introduced. Color can be mixed and form created. It can also create a satisfying and beautiful piece, 
      but without the paintbrush, movement and emotion can't be added. </p>
    <p>With a paintbrush in hand, the artist can create a masterpiece. They can reflect life, or they can create abstract,
       thoughtful pieces. Art evokes emotion, and the paintbrush helps to create that experience.</p>
    <p>Just like the paintbrush, Javascript creates movement within a website. It takes the HTML canvas and CSS medium and creates 
      an interactive experience for users.</p>

    <h3>What is control flow?</h3>
<p>Control flow describes the order in which code is executed. In Javascript, 
  this generally means running from the first line of code to the last in that order. 
  This is unless Javascript is instructed to change direction. 
  This is most commonly experienced with <span class="bold">loops.</span></p>
  <p><span class="bold">Loops</span> instruct the browser to run through the internal code a set number of times, 
    redirecting the control flow until fully executed. They take many forms, such as the <code>for</code> loop, <code>for...of</code>, <code>for...in</code>, <code>do...while</code> etc. 
    They may appear confusing and unintuitive at first, but they can get a little easier when you realise that many everyday actions 
    can be thought of in terms of a loop. Take having a dinner party for example: the control flow leads you from inviting your guests in, sitting them down, interacting with them, 
    eating with them, and then saying goodbye. But there are several loops in there somewhere that interrupt that flow as you have to complete them 
    the specified number of times until you can move on to the next. When you're serving up dinner you have to place the food on the plate
    as many times as needed until you can serve everyone - if you have four guests, you repeat it four times etc.
  </p>
  <p>If you want to get deeper into loops, you could also throw <span class="bold">conditionals</span> in there too, like an <code>if</code> statement. While you're going through 
  your plating up food loop, if your guest can't eat a certain ingredient, you can skip over it, or give them something else instead, and then loop around to the next guest. </p>
  <p>Once you begin to think of loops and conditionals as phsyical actions like this, they become a lot less intimidating.</p>

  <h3>What is the DOM, and how can I interact with it?</h3>
  <p>The DOM, or <span class="bold">Document Object Model</span> is a representation of a webpage, or document, as a tree-like structure, or <span class="bold">Node Tree</span>.
  Like a family tree, the node tree represents the structure of the document, its content and how each element, or <span class="bold">nodes</span> relate to each other. 
  Every HTML element is its own node. Nodes are divided into a heirarchy of anscestors and descendents: <span class="bold">grand-parent</span> nodes,
<span class="bold">parent</span> nodes, and <span class="bold">child</span> nodes.</p>
<p><span class="bold">But what's the point of all this?</span>The answer lies at the top of the tree: every node is descended from the <code>document</code>. 
Calling the document in your code allows a user or programmer to interact with and manipulate every single node on a webpage. You can do this in Javascript by 
searching for the node you want to affect with: <code>document.querySelector('ThisIsTheNodeYouAreLookingFor')</code> for example.</p>
<p>Finding the node then creates endless possibilities, you could:</p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>Manipulate the code immediately when the page loads by changing it, for example changing the colour of the text with <code>document.querySelector('.class').style.color = "pink"</code></li>
      <li>Add an Event Listener, like a cue that indicates when the code can be manipulated through actions on the webpage, for example when you click on a button it changes the color to pink: 
        <code>document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', functionThatChangesColor)</code> </li>
    </ul>

<p>Back to the dinner party analogy, the last time though, I promise. Within your dinner party the DOM could be seen in the following way:</p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li><span class="bold">Document: </span>The dining room</li>
      <li><span class="bold">The Node Tree: </span>The seating arrangement</li>
      <li><span class="bold">The Nodes: </span>Your guests</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Event Listeners: </span>Social cues</li>
    </ul>
  <p>To serve dinner to a guest you must go to the dining room, walk past the other guests in the seating arrangement until you get to your chosen one, wait for a cue,
    like the clock striking 7pm (or a complaint if you're not good at time management), then place the food down in front of them, or: 
    <code>document.querySelector('guest').addEventListener('complaint', serveDinnerFunction)</code>
  </p>

  <h3>Functions?</h3>
  <p>Functions are instructions given to your browser to do certain things. There are really just endless possibilities for what you 
    could do with a function, it's up to what you put in the block of code. They are very useful pieces of code as they are re-usable, so you can 
    keep calling one line every time you want to use it rather than rewriting out your code every single time. 
  </p>
  <p>You begin writing a basic function by using the <span class="bold">function keyword</span> and the <span class="bold">name</span> 
    of your function followed by brackets: <span class="bold">()</span> and curly brackets: <span class="bold">{}</span>. The things that you want
  to happen go between the curly brackets. Like so: </p>
  
  <div class="image-div">
  <img class="image" src="../img/function-example-1.png" alt="Example of a simple function with the layout: function thisIsMyFunction() {}">
</div>

<p>You can place parameters within the brackets as placeholders to make your code re-usable. For example, if you want to do the same thing
  to different elements on the page, you can put a placeholder in the brackets and replace the element you want to change with the placeholder in your code. parameters
  can have any name, it doesn't really matter what you call them as they're just placeholders
  for other elements. For example:
</p>
<div class="image-div">
  <img src="../img/function-example-2.png" alt="Example of a simple function with the parameter of 'parameter'">
</div>
<p>To implement your function, you need to call it. You do this by calling the name alongside empty brackets for functions without a parameter: <code>thisIsMyFunction()</code>
, or with the element you want to use to replace the placeholder: <code>thisIsMyFunction(elementIWantToUse)</code></p>


<h3>The difference between arrays and objects</h3>
<p>At first glance, arrays and objects appear very similar and it can be difficult to distinguish the appropriate times to use each.
  They both hold collections of data.
</p>

<p>Planning for your dinner party may help (I'm sorry, I lied..... But this is the last time now).</p>
<ul class="article-list">
  <li><span class="bold">Arrays: </span> An array is like the menu that you will give your guests. You would lay out each course
  on your menu separately from one another, but it would all come under the title of your menu. It's the same with arrays: They are a list of elements stored 
under a single element. Your menu array could look like: <br>
 <code>Menu['Bruschetta', 'Soup', 'Fish', 'Tiramisu']</code></li>
<li><span class="bold">Objects: </span>Objects are like a more detailed version of your list. They contain properties that represent different types of
information about that object in key value pairs. They would be like the recipe for each course on your menu with different points of information describing the 
properties, it would written like: <br>
 <code>Bruschetta = { <br>
  process: 'toasted', <br>
  breadType: 'chiabatta', <br>
  garlic: true, <br>
  ingredientsCost: 13 }
</code></li>
</ul>

<p>As their structure is different, so is their use. They can be accessed by:</p>
<ul class="article-list">
  <li><span class="bold">Arrays: </span>Calling on a property via the index. Items in programming start from 0 rather than 1, so if someone asked about
  your 'bruschetta' on the menu, they would call it as: <code>bruschetta[0]</code>.</li>
  <li><span class="bold">Objects: </span>Calling on a value via the key, in dot notation or bracket notation. The type of bread in your bruschetta would be called by 
  from <code>bruschetta.breadType</code> , or <code>bruschetta[breadType]</code> </li>
</ul>
