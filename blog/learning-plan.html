    <h2>My Bootcamp Learning plan</h2>
    <p class="date-time">
      Fri 10 Feb 2023
    </p>

    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      I don’t think that has changed much. I am still very interested in eventually learning about developing games, but I think I 
      still definitely want to build a career in web dev. I’ve been really enjoying making the blog with html and css, and 
      have been thinking about ways it could become more dynamic with Javascript - like adding tags to articles and creating a 
      search bar for those tags etc. 
    </p>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>
      I think my strengths are still exactly the same, but would add perhaps that the love-of-learning has also extended to 
      learning about myself. I’ve really gotten into problem solving methods and have changed a lot of my mindset about how I tackle 
      problems. This has also helped with my issues focusing as well. If I can break down a problem and solve little bits I can keep
       myself motivated to stay focused on something. Comparing myself to others and difficulty with new people is still an ongoing 
       issue, so they will be my biggest limitations in Bootcamp. I have had some very good advice from my facilitators around feeling 
       more comfortable asking questions, so I will try to give it a go the next time I am stuck. The more I do it the more comfortable 
       I will feel. 
    </p>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
    <p>
      Sticking to the routine and asking questions when I’m stuck/giving feedback during pair programming. I will be fine getting 
      up for the 8:45 starts, it’s just the string routine for the bootcamp. I like to take breaks to go and work in the garden, 
      or take my dog outside, so being on a school-like schedule will take some getting used to. Alongside the issues I’ve already
       discussed in the previous question, giving good feedback will also be slightly difficult, though I think with practice i will 
       be able to overcome it. I don’t like making people feel bad, and although I think feedback is very valuable for myself, I worry 
       that I would upset someone by suggesting things they could do differently, or picking up on any mistakes. 
    </p>

    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
      To update from the foundations learning plan, I think I’ve managed to learn a lot more about problem solving and balancing work. 
      I’m really happy with the progress I’ve made in such a short amount of time. I think collaboration is the biggest human skill I 
      want to develop during bootcamp - which encompasses asking questions, giving feedback, seeking out people to collaborate with, 
      communicating effectively etc - a lot of skills that I lack.
    </p>

    <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
    <p>
      I think they’re the same as the expectations of the foundations team, though a bit more intense as it is a more challenging 
      course. I would expect the bootcamp team to be there to support me, not only with technical questions, but more importantly
       with human skills. It’s such an intense course that I think even the most resilient people will begin to struggle, so it’s 
       so important for the bootcamp team to be there to reassure everyone. I still definitely think that they’re there for guidance 
       rather than answering questions directly, which I’ve come to prefer. It would be easy to correct someone’s function by just 
       rewriting, but I would prefer an explanation of why it wouldn’t work to put me in the right direction to look up what I could 
       do to make it work. It’s also a good introduction to how things would work in a job - you wouldn’t get a senior dev to rewrite 
       your code for you, you would ask them about a concept and they would explain just enough for you to be able to go and do your 
       own research. 
    </p>

    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
      I plan to also follow the guidelines that the facilitators have suggested, with the 20 minutes of researching and then 
      asking for help. But I would also like to add that I’m sure everyone will have grand ideas for the projects during bootcamp, 
      it seems like the possibilities are endless at the moment, but I would need to know when to give up on an idea if I didn’t have 
      the skills to do it yet. Time in bootcamp is so precious, so I can’t afford to be wasting it on one complicated feature.
    </p>

    <h2>My Foundations learning plan</h2>
    <p class="date-time">
      Fri 20 Jan 2023
    </p>
    
    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Short term:</span> My short term goal is to get a position as a front-end developer at a larger company 
      where I can learn from senior devs and become more experienced. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Long term:</span> I do eventually want to move to a start-up when I become more experienced, as they 
      usually don’t have the resources for training junior devs. I’ve worked with start-ups before and I love the working culture 
      and ambition. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The ultimate long term goal is to continue learning and stay curious about how things work. The tech world is always changing, 
      and there are always new skills to learn and pick up.
      I also want to have a look into video game development when I become more experienced.
    </p>

    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Strengths: </span> Resilience, creativity and love of learning. When things knock me down I do whatever
      it takes to pick myself back up again. I may get annoyed in the immediate moment, but I find it easy to find my positivity again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Weaknesses: </span>Focus, introversion, and comparison. Because I love learning new things I get 
      distracted quite easily, especially in tech where there are endless things to learn. As I’m introverted, I get shy when working 
      with other people, so I need to keep reminding myself that collaboration is important. I struggle with comparing myself to other 
      people, and will avoid asking for help as I’m afraid I’ll be looked down upon, so I need to keep reminding myself that this is 
      definitely not the case and that I won’t improve without asking for help. 
    </p>

    <h3>What skills would you like to develop at dev academy</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Problem solving skills: </span>I’ve never really had a specific strategy for solving problems, 
      I usually just go at it head on until I fix it. It’s worked for me so far, but that won’t always be the case, especially in 
      something technical. I would really like to improve my skills at breaking down the problem into smaller problems and working at 
      it logically.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Collaboration: </span>I would really like to improve my inability to ask for help and collaboration skills. 
      I do genuinely enjoy being around other people, but I’m usually too shy to interact. As I know collaboration is THE most important 
      skill when working in a team, I would like to develop my skills so I can make other people feel comfortable as well as myself. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Balance: </span>I usually lose focus the most when I’ve burnt myself out. I go through cycles of hyper-focus
      and then lose it. I would like to develop a better work-life balance so I don’t burn myself out immediately. 
      </p>

    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload</h3>
    <p>
      I plan to manage my workload by sticking to timeboxes and dividing each sprint/ week’s workload into daily routines at the 
      beginning of the week. This will allow me to know what to expect each day so I can plan accordingly, and will help prevent me 
      from getting burnt out and to keep my commitments with other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      If things begin building up I will take a step back, take a break and then plan ahead accordingly so I can divide up my time 
      evenly again. 
    </p>


    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <p>
      I plan to follow the guidelines that the facilitators suggested, to try and work out the problem myself for a maximum of
      20 minutes, and then ask for help in the discord channels, and then directly to my facilitators David and Naomi if I am still stuck. 
    </p>
    <p>I believe in the power of positive affirmation and mantras, so I have stuck a reminder to my monitor that I can take a few 
      minutes to read and calm down with to get the confidence to ask for help. 
    </p>

      <img id="mantras" src="../img/mantras.png" alt="a sticky note with positive affirmations about asking for help" width="400px">
    </div>

    <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      The facilitators are there to support me during my learning journey in both technical and core areas. 
      They are not there to correct me or solve my problems for me, but to guide me on the right track if I am blocked or need help 
      (during reasonable hours of the day) so I can learn to grow. They will be understanding and supportive during my learning journey.
    </p>

    <h3>Any scheduling information, such as block out times</h3>
    <p>
      From 1:30-2pm during foundations, and half an hour during lunch times at bootcamp. 
      As I will be working remotely for the entirety of the course, and will be the only person at home during the day, 
      I will need to take my dog for a walk.
    </p>
