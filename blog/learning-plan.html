  <h2>My learning plan</h2>
  <p class="date-time">Fri 20 Jan 2023</p>
  
  <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
  <p><span class="bold">Short term:</span> My short term goal is to get a position as a front-end developer at a larger company where I can learn from senior devs and become more experienced. 
  </p>
  <p><span class="bold">Long term:</span> I do eventually want to move to a start-up when I become more experienced, as they usually don’t have the resources for training junior devs. I’ve worked with start-ups before and I love the working culture and ambition. </p>
<p>The ultimate long term goal is to continue learning and stay curious about how things work. The tech world is always changing, and there are always new skills to learn and pick up.
  I also want to have a look into video game development when I become more experienced.
</p>

<h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
  <p><span class="bold">Strengths: </span> Resilience, creativity and love of learning. When things knock me down I do whatever it takes to pick myself back up again. I may get annoyed in the immediate moment, but I find it easy to find my positivity again.
  </p>
  <p><span class="bold">Weaknesses: </span>Focus, introversion, and comparison. Because I love learning new things I get distracted quite easily, especially in tech where there are endless things to learn. As I’m introverted, I get shy when working with other people, so I need to keep reminding myself that collaboration is important. I struggle with comparing myself to other people, and will avoid asking for help as I’m afraid I’ll be looked down upon, so I need to keep reminding myself that this is definitely not the case and that I won’t improve without asking for help. </p>

<h3>What skills would you like to develop at dev academy</h3>
<p><span class="bold">Problem solving skills: </span>I’ve never really had a specific strategy for solving problems, I usually just go at it head on until I fix it. It’s worked for me so far, but that won’t always be the case, especially in something technical. I would really like to improve my skills at breaking down the problem into smaller problems and working at it logically.
</p>
<p><span class="bold">Collaboration: </span>I would really like to improve my inability to ask for help and collaboration skills. I do genuinely enjoy being around other people, but I’m usually too shy to interact. As I know collaboration is THE most important skill when working in a team, I would like to develop my skills so I can make other people feel comfortable as well as myself. 
</p>
<p><span class="bold">Balance: </span>I usually lose focus the most when I’ve burnt myself out. I go through cycles of hyper-focus and then lose it. I would like to develop a better work-life balance so I don’t burn myself out immediately. </p>

<h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload</h3>
<p>I plan to manage my workload by sticking to timeboxes and dividing each sprint/ week’s workload into daily routines at the beginning of the week. This will allow me to know what to expect each day so I can plan accordingly, and will help prevent me from getting burnt out and to keep my commitments with other people.
</p>
<p>If things begin building up I will take a step back, take a break and then plan ahead accordingly so I can divide up my time evenly again. 
</p>


<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
<p>I plan to follow the guidelines that the facilitators suggested, to try and work out the problem myself for a maximum of 20 minutes, and then ask for help in the discord channels, and then directly to my facilitators David and Naomi if I am still stuck. 
</p>
<p>I believe in the power of positive affirmation and mantras, so I have stuck a reminder to my monitor that I can take a few minutes to read and calm down with to get the confidence to ask for help. </p>

<h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
<p>The facilitators are there to support me during my learning journey in both technical and core areas. They are not there to correct me or solve my problems for me, but to guide me on the right track if I am blocked or need help (during reasonable hours of the day) so I can learn to grow. They will be understanding and supportive during my learning journey.</p>

<h3>Any scheduling information, such as block out times</h3>
<p>From 1:30-2pm during foundations, and half an hour during lunch times at bootcamp. As I will be working remotely for the entirety of the course, and will be the only person at home during the day, I will need to take my dog for a walk</p>
