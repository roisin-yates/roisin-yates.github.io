<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I'm Róisín(ro-sheen). I'm 23 years old and originally from Christchurch, but now based in Auckland.</p>
<p>I'm a very artsy person, so this is my first time really doing anything like this. I studied History of Art for my undergrad specialising 
  in Bronze age Chinese bells - Super specific, and NOT tech. I was originally set to enter a career in Museum
  Conservation, but had the opportunity to do a 3 month internship at a SaaS company before I started. I fell in love with the work I was 
  helping do with the dev team and learnt html, css and javascript to build a (pretty bad) webpage for them. So I decided to join Dev
  Academy so I could learn more about programming and join a dev team properly in the future. 
</p>
<p>In my spare time I like painting landscapes, which also means that I love travelling to see different landscapes and gain inspiration.
  My favourite place is definitely in the alps, and I'd love to own a little log cabin down by Queenstown one day. 
</p>
<p>I also love animals and have grown up with some fostered and adopted pets, including hedgehogs, peacocks and a segull that 
  we were rehabilitating at one point. I now have my own little dog called Bess, who's keeping me company while I do this course remotely.
She's quite old, but she still has a lot of energy and can do insanely guilt-tripping puppydog eyes.</p>
<p>I can't wait to get to know everyone else on this course, and I'm excited to go on this new journy with you all :D</p>
