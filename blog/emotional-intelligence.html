      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence (or Emotional Quotient/EQ) is the ability to recognise, 
        manage and understand emotions within yourself and other people. 
        Motivation may also be included: having clear goals and working towards them 
        indicates an understanding of yourself and a willingness to better yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different levels, or stages, of emotional intelligence:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Identification:</span>  Identifying and understanding emotional signals, including verbal
          (phrasing, tone, volume) and non-verbal (body language, facial expressions) in yourself and in others.
        </li>
        <li> 
          <span class="bold">Feeling:</span> Allowing yourself and others to feel and experience emotions rather than suppressing them 
        </li>
        <li> 
          <span class="bold">Understanding:</span> Understanding how emotions can affect the environment around you, both negatively 
          and positively
        </li>
        <li> 
          <span class="bold">Managing:</span> Responding and regulating the emotions. Knowing your cues and reactions and managing
           them in the way you know works for you. Helping others to manage their emotions - if someone wants to be comforted, 
           comfort them so they can work through their emotions. If someone wants to be alone, give them space etc.  
          </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>How is Emotional Intelligence different from IQ</h3>

        <div class="table">
          <p> 
            <span class="bold">Intelligence Quotient(IQ):</span>

            <li>Memory</li>
          </ul>

            <span class="bold">Emotional Intelligence/EQ:</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Reflects your understanding and management of emotions, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Awareness of others around you</li>
            <li>Empathy</li>
            <li>Communication and Co-operation</li>
            <li>Management of stress</li>
            <li>Mindfulness</li>

        Measured by:
      </p>
      <p>
        IQ can be measured through multiple tests that incorporate puzzles, mathematic equations and patterns. Popular tests include: 
        <span class="bold">the Stanford-Binet Intelligence scale </span>  and <span class="bold">the Wechsler Adult 
        intelligence scale</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        EQ can be measured through different personality tests, 
        either filled out by yourself to evaluate your own abilities, 
        or filled out by people close to you who can interpret your behaviour. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="bold">
        Bias:
      </p>
      <p>
        Both IQ and EQ are impacted by environmental conditions around you. 
        IQ can be impacted by socio-ecnomic status, education and health. 
        EQ can be impacted by psychological health, trauma, culture and upbringing
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="bold">
        Development
      </p>
      <p>
        IQ has traditionally been seen as static and unchanging, 
        but it is now theorised that IQ can be improved by working on puzzles, 
        learning a new skill (e.g musical instrument) and learning a new language.
      </p>
      <p>
        EQ can be developed through self-reflection, such as meditation, journalling and communication.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Why is EQ important</h3>
      <p>
        Whilst IQ was traditionally seen as more important for success, it is now shown that EQ plays a more important role. 
        A Forbes study showed that 90% of the top performers had a high EQ. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence is very important for good communication and relationship building skills. 
        It is a crucial skill for leadership in any career. It can help with stress management, teamwork and 
        conflict management.
