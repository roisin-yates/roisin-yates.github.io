    <h2>Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p class="date-time">
      Mon 30 Jan 2023
    </p>

    <h3>What is Neuroplasticity and how can it help?</h3>
    <p>
      The brain is made up of around 100 billion neurons. Researchers used to believe that the creation of new neurons 
      stopped once a baby had been born, defining a person’s ability and character then and there. Now it’s recognised 
      that a person’s brain can change through experiences, literally changing in shape by strengthening pathways between neurons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change, reorganise and strengthen these neural pathways as a response to stimulating 
      activity. Strengthening these pathways can aid in memory, focus and ability to learn and maintain skills. It can also help the brain 
      to recover faster after strokes or other brain injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most recognised way to increase neuroplasticity is to stimulate positive change in your brain - 
      like learning a new language, or instrument or finding a creative outlet. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This also includes getting enough rest, exercise and practicing mindfullness. 
      Sleep helps to strengthen the parts of the neurons (dendrites) that help to transmit information between neurons. 
      This creates greater brain plasticity. Sleep and regular mindfulness also have positive affects on physical and mental health,
      which creates a better environment for stimulating your brain. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Exercise can also help to prevent neuron loss, particularly for memory, and can boost brain plasticity.
    </p>

      <h3>How Neuroplasticity can help with this course</h3>
    <p>
      All three of the most common ways to strengthen neural pathways are important for studying at Dev Academy. The reflections and mindfulness
      calm the brain and help to strengthen memory. Getting enough sleep, exercising and eating the right foods can help make put you in a 
      better headspace, particularly when faced with challenging material in bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will keep up with all of these activities as I learn. I know I'm not very good at eating the right foods and often skip lunch, 
      and since I'm sitting at a desk most of the day I'm not getting much exercise. Neither of these will put me in the right headspace 
      for coping with challanges, and will make it more difficult for my brain to develop and adapt to retain the course material. Regular 
      meditation will also help to keep me calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I personally really enjoyed <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886">this resource from verywellmind.com</a>
      and found it very informative. I would recommend having a read through to learn more about neuroplasticity and how you can begin
      strengthening your neural pathways.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the Growth mindset and how can it help?</h3>
    <p>
      Along with previous beliefs about neuroplasticity, it was also believed that your abilities were set in stone - things
      you were talented at and could improve, and things you weren’t good at and were doomed to fail with. Dr Carol Dweck’s 
      work explores the difference between a growth and the traditional fixed mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Growth mindset is the way we perceive our character and own abilities. The way we think about ourselves affects the 
      way we feel and our performance, and positive beliefs help to develop your abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing this helps you to give yourself the motivation to stick at something as being a beginner is only a temporary 
      state. It challenges you to get past your need for instant gratification and to enjoy being bad at something in order to
      become better at it. 
    </p>

    <h3>What I thought and how I will integrate it into this course</h3>
    <p> 
      I knew that any skills would have to develop over time and that the only way to get better is to keep practicing, 
      but I also believed that there would be some things I was naturally good at and some things that I would always be bad at. 
      It was a nice surprise to read that research has actually proven that not to be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will try to look at learning as more of a journey rather than a destination. Learning is lifelong, and there isn’t going 
      to be a magical point where I just become good at it. This will help me to enjoy the process and get dopamine from the process 
      rather than the end result, keeping me motivated. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I will also try to ask for help more often and take any feedback as good rather than negative. You have to make mistakes 
      in order to improve, so any tips to get better or comments on what I could improve or shouldn’t do are extremely valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, linked to that, I will try to not be scared to make mistakes. Making mistakes doesn’t make you ‘stupid’, if 
      anything it shows that you’re willing to give something a go even if you don’t necessarily know the answer. 
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>Final thoughts and what it means for my learning journey</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to the methods I've already discussed, I will seriously need to start asking for help or feedback and 
      interacting with my peers more. I know it’s very difficult for me to do, so I need to bite the bullet and just begin. 
      This also includes enjoying making mistakes and making an active effort to learn from them rather than feeling bad.
