  <h2>Identity & Values </h2>
  <p class="date-time">Fri 20 Jan 2023</p>
  <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now. </h3>
  <p>A long time ago, but I think it helped shape my personality. In year 6 some girls in my class found a bumblebee without any wings. They decided to look after it and put it in a box with a bottletop full of honey. They kept it in the classroom for 3 days, after which I took it outside after school and stamped on it, killing it.
  </p>
  <p>I am a bee-murderer, but I can explain my thought process. I respect the meaning behind their actions, and obviously I would always try to help an injured animal. Every life is valuable, even tiny little bee ones. Bees are also hugely important to our eco-system and a shortage of bees would have catastrophic effects on every life on the planet. HOWEVER, the bee was very injured and they were keeping it in a closed box inside a stuffy classroom. The honey they were feeding it was very processed and would have been dangerous for it to eat. They would pass it around at lunch time which I assumed would cause the bee stress. It had no wings so it would have been unable to survive in the wild, and I thought it would have been unhappy in the box. I thought killing it would put it out of its misery and would cause it much less stress than either letting it go into an environment in pain where it can’t live its life or keeping it in a box for the same reason. This devastated the other girls, especially since I told them what I did - this wasn’t a confession or apology, but was to tell them off for keeping a wild animal in a state of pain. 
  </p>
  <p>This is very morally gray, but I honestly did weigh up the values and chose the action that followed my values the most. I didn’t want the bee to be in pain and thought the kindest thing would be to kill it since it would have a prolonged and painful death in the wild or in captivity. I do still think I’d make the same decision today, though I would be more mature about it. The other girls were just doing what they thought was best, and reflecting on it now, it wasn’t my job to “educate” them based on my opinion, doing so was actually just being cruel to them.</p>

  <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
  <p>My family is quite conservative, not in terms of politics but in terms of personality. They’re not big risk takers and tend to prioritise activities that will make them feel more secure rather than their passion. My dad has a phD in Archaeology and is very passionate about it, but was convinced to become a lawyer instead by his parents. He doesn’t enjoy it but he feels like he has to do it because it's a more secure job. As such I try to avoid taking big risks and usually follow things that I believe to be more secure, even if they’re not things I enjoy. This also influenced me to be more introverted. 
  </p>
  <p>Both my parents, but especially my dad, are very emotional. They care deeply about other living beings. My mum is a vet, so as a family we’ve looked after hundreds of injured animals. Because of this I hold respect and empathy as my highest values. I try my best to follow them myself and be kind to everyone - I did quite well in customer service even though I didn’t enjoy it (introverted) since I tried to be polite and helpful to everyone. However, I do hold high standards for other people. This can have a negative impact as I can easily get annoyed at people I find to be disrespectful or unethical, even if it’s a very small action that they may not do deliberately. </p>
  <p>Finally, the culture in New Zealand has shaped my identity a lot, particularly the tall poppy syndrome. While I try not to cut other people down, I don’t like ‘blowing my own trumpet’ and truthfully had a hard time writing these answers with anything positive. I subconsciously believe that I shouldn’t say “I’m so empathetic, I’m creative, I’m friendly” and should focus on negative traits because praise should come from other people not yourself (This is not true, everyone should celebrate what they’re good at)
  </p>

  <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
<p> <span class="bold">Creativity: </span> I’ve always considered myself to be a creative person - before dev academy I was going to follow a career path in Art History - specifically museum conservation studies. I think this could support my learning as I can find new ways to interpret requirements and can visualise things well. </p>
  <p> <span class="bold">Perseverance:</span>  This is actually a tricky one to explain, because in the next answer you’ll see I struggle with staying focused. I really enjoy problem solving and can persevere with problems quite well, even if it usually brute forcing my way through it rather than finding a clever solution. This will help my learning as I won’t get discouraged by issues I face and will always try to find a solution. </p>
<p> <span class="bold">Empathy:</span> Trying to ignore the tall poppy syndrome, I would say I was empathetic. I do think that empathy is relevant to studying as obviously we’ll be studying in a group and doing pair programming, so co-operating is very important. I would also say that having empathy helps to strengthen your open-mindedness and problem solving, if you can see things from other people’s points of view, then you will find it easier to see problems from different perspectives as well. </p>


<h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
<p> <span class="bold">Focus:</span>  I do find it very difficult to stay focused for long periods of time. I get distracted easily and often end up procrastinating even if it’s something I enjoy doing. If I know I need to do something I will do anything but that action - if I have to clean the house I would prefer to learn a language instead, but if I have to learn a language I would prefer to clean the house. The way this would affect my learning journey is obvious…</p>
<p> <span class="bold">Hyper-focus:</span>  Paradoxical, but I can explain. When I really get into something I ignore everything else and just focus on that. I can spend days working on a project if I manage to break past my focus issues. But you could also call this obsessive. It may seem good, but I can burn out very quickly and then I’m straight back to struggling to focus. This could negatively affect my learning if I stray from the timeboxing. I will get burnt out, procrastinate, obsess and burn out again. A lovely vicious circle. </p>
<p> <span class="bold">Introversion:</span>  I am definitely more introverted and can get scared with the thought of talking to new people. This is definitely very limiting as I won’t put myself out there as much and may miss out on opportunities or won’t get the most out of an activity. This also means that I am afraid of asking for help - I would choose to spend days trying to figure something out rather than spend 5 minutes admitting to someone I’m stuck. </p>


<h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
<p>In one of my previous customer service jobs where I was the assistant manager, I was asked to train a new staff member. She was in her late 60s and found it difficult being in a lower position than a 22 year old. English also wasn’t her first language, so there was a bit of a communication barrier between us and with our customers. I tried to teach her the basics of our products and how to use the POS , but she struggled a lot. I took pride in the storage room that I had organised, but she struggled to understand my system so when I would see things out of place it would cause a lot of tension. We also started to get complaints about her from customers as she would follow them around the store. 
</p>
<p>The main strategy I chose was to switch up my communication tactics. Rather than telling her what to do I would ask her what she thought she should do in certain situations, and if the information she gave me wasn’t ideal (according to our handbook), rather than telling her she was wrong I would say something like “That does sound like a good strategy, but in this situation is there anything you can think of that would be a better fit?”. After a few weeks she still didn’t improve, so I just started avoiding working with her. She listened better to the actual manager, who was around the same age. After a few months things still weren’t improving, so she was moved to a different location. </p>
<p>Reflecting on it, I think my strategy of switching up communication was almost on the right track, but I was so focused on trying to change my language that I forgot about behaviour. She couldn’t trust me because she didn’t find my role above hers as fair since she had more experience and felt I wasn’t mature enough, and micro-managing her almost confirmed that. I think if I could do it again I would focus more on my behaviour as a whole and give her reasons to respect my position. My strategy would be along the lines of: giving her more responsibility around the store so she felt respected and interacting with customers in front of her in the way that our handbook described rather than just focusing on trying to explain the handbook to her.
